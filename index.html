    <h1>The Honey Badger</h1>
    <p> Every animal in the Sub-Sahara thinks they
      are the toughest, <em>until</em> they encounter the <strong>Honey Badger</strong>.Their agility, explosive ferocity, razor sharp teeth and claws, bone shattering jaw, and thick skin poses a challenge for the few animals dare hunt it. However, perhaps the most advantageous feat of the Honey Badger, is their sheer willpower. Taking on predators twice its size, even the mightiest of Lions know to think twice before running the duel. These creatures can be seen roaming the savannah, often covered in battle injuries, from broken limbs, exposed guts, impaled with porcupine quills, each wound a story of the battle they won. </p>
